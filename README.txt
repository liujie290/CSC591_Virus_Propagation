The answers and code are present in the Virus Propagation - Option 1.ipynb and an
example run is present in Virus Propagation - Option 1.html. This contains code for
both parts as well as the answers to questions to be included in the report.

To run the ipython notebook, you would have to initialize the notebook from the folder
that contains the static.network graph file. The code file has been hardcoded for
the static.network graph and to run on any other graph one would have to change the
filename variable wherever static.network is present. Also we assume that the first
value of a graph file represents number of nodes in a 0 graph file.

To run the output:

Open the Virus Propagation - Option 1.html in a browser

Or

cd path_to_static.network_file

ipython notebook
Open notebook Virus Propagation - Option 1.ipynb

OR

cd path_to_static.network_file
ipython Virus Propagation - Option 1.ipynb
